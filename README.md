# stock-analysis


## **Overview of Project**: 
In this project, we must analyze the Stock Market Dataset using VBA solution code. We will be looping through the data to collect stock performances and then refactor the code to make it more efficient by taking few steps, using less memory, and improving our logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

### **Purpose**
The purpose of this project was to refractor the Microsoft VBA code to collect stock information for both years 2017 and 2018, to analyze the stock performances. These stock performances will show which stock is worth investing in. The first analysis of this data was successful, but we have to refractor this code to increase the efficiency of the original code which will be more effective in many ways. 

## **Results**
'1a) Create a ticker Index
•	Created the ticketIndex variable and set it equal to zero before iterating all over the rows.
 

    '1b) Create three output arrays
•	Created the three output arrays: tickerVolumes, tickerStartingPrices and tickerEndingprices. TickerVolume array should be long data type, and tickerStartingPrices should be a single data type.
    
 

    ''2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero.
 
     
    '4) Loop through your arrays to output the Ticker, Total Daily Volume, and Return.

### **Summary**


1.	What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
**Pros**
•	Refactoring helps clean the coding process. It will make the code more efficient by only using few steps, it uses less memory and improves the logic of the code which makes it easier to understand.  
•	The logic of code becomes easier to understand when it contains nested conditional and loops. 
•	By adding comments and documentation, it makes it easier to understand. 
Cons: 
•	Refactoring can cause many issues at the same time. Sometimes the data can be too large for not having proper form for existing codes. 
•	If you were to copy and paste the coding, you might run into duplication. 
•	Refactoring can affect the testing of outcomes. There were multiple outcomes received while running the data. 
2.	How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
**Pros**
•	Using the original VBA helps in the result of the coding. We have an idea of the result and it helps you understand the coding. All we must do is to update and improve our code to make it efficient for users.
•	Makes the code cleaner and more well-organized so if you need to make any changes, it will be easier to understand and easy to maintain. 
**Cons**
•	Using the original VBA script can help refractor but at the same time you might run into some issues. With few miscommunications with the coding can change the result. It will be unable to provide the same outcome. 
•	We have to re-check and pay attention to the code refactoring multiple times to run the correct analysis.
